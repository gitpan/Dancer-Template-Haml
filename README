NAME
    Dancer::Template::Haml - Haml wrapper for Dancer

SYNOPSIS
     set template => 'haml';
     
 get '/bazinga', sub {
            template 'bazinga' => {
                    title => 'Bazinga!',
                    content => 'Bazinga?',
            };
     };

    Then, on "views/bazinga.haml":

     !!!
     %html{ :xmlns => "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", :lang => "en", "xml:lang" => "en"}
       %head
         %title= title
       %body
         #content
           %strong= content

    And... bazinga!

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Text::Haml module.

    In order to use this engine, set the following setting as the following:

        template: haml

    This can be done in your config.yml file or directly in your app code
    with the set keyword.

SEE ALSO
    Dancer, Text::Haml

TODO
    The usage of helpers, filters and attributes. This will be implemented
    once Dancer has capabilities to take specific parameters for each
    templating engine it supports.
